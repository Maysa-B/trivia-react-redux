## Trivia with React and Redux

This project was developed at the end of block 16, where we produced this game in a group. I had the pleasure of working with [Arthur Coelho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurccoelho/), [Dêvis Tenório](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d%C3%AAvis-coelho-ten%C3%B3rio-3a5a88231/), [Matheus Cardoso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-cardoso-314010a6/) and [Sophia Gazzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-gazzi/).

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. All project is produced from this [API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).
2. There is a login page.
3. The user can adjust the settings to select how many questions they desire, the question's subject, and the hardness level.
4. The user has 30 seconds to answer, after that, the question is marked as wrong.
5. The score is calculated based on how much time was spent answering and the hardness level.
6. At the end, there is a ranking, with all results ranked from the best to the worst.
7. The group developed tests to cover 100% of the application.
